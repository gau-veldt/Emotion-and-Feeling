This extension adds feelings to every person in the world.

Each person carries a feeling (which is cleverly kept off inventory listings) that may be changed in the story during play.
The player has a command called 'mood' to query the mood.  Of course the mood command is more useful
in multiple-character games where each character may feel differently.

Each personal feeling is independent from those of other people.
Computed adjectives allow querying an actor's emotional state in the story.
A clever script might create rulesets to modify a character's behavior (or possible behavior)
due to changes in the character's mood.
